tcpdump -i lo -> ping 127.0.0.1
tcpdump -i enp4s0 port 80
tcpdump -D -> it will display all interfaces
tcpdump -i lo -A -> ping 127.0.0.1 -> display in ascii
tcpdump -i lo -c 5 -> ping 127.0.0.1 -> only capture 5 packets
tcpdump -i lo -w file.pcap -> ping 127.0.0.1 -> capture and store in file.pcap
tcpdump -r file.pcap -> just run this command store packet will be display
tcpdump -i enp4s0 tcp
tcpdump -i enp4s0 -n -A -xx port 22 (for packet generation do shh process ssh
aspit@ipaddress)
tcpdump -i enp4s0 -n -A -xx port 80 (for packet generation ping from 1pc to another
pc)
tcpdump -i enp4s0 -n -A -xx icmp
-------------3B Wireshark--------------
1. Filter traffic on specific IP address
This will display all traffic for the IP entered, source or destination.
ip.addr==192.168.1.2
2. Filter by source address
This will only show traffic where the source IP address is 192.168.1.2
ip.src==192.168.1.2
3. Filter by destination address
Displays only traffic for the matching destination IP.
ip.dst==192.168.1.2
4. Filter on TCP port
tcp.port==80
tcp.srcport==80
tcp.dstport==80
5. Filter background network noise
There are several protocols that can be very noisy, it sometimes helps to filter
this out so you can focus on other traffic.
!(arp or icmp or dns)
This will filter out arp, icmp and DNS traffic.
6.Filter on port and IP Address
If you want to see traffic from a certain IP on a specific port use this filter
tcp.port 80 && ip.addr == 192.168.1.2
This will show only port 80 (https) that has IP 192.168.1.2 in the source or
destination.
7. Detecting SYN Floods (Possible DDoS attacks)
tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0
