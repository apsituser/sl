cd
cd /etc/snort
search for snort.conf by ls
cat /etc/snort/snort.conf (it will include)
include /etc/snort/rules/rules/icmp.rules
include /etc/snort/rules/rules/telnet.rules
-------->include /etc/snort/rules/rules/myrules.rules
if above is present then cat /etc/snort/rules/myrules.rules -> should contain
include 3 rules then type (snort -d -l... search for this command below and
continue from there)
Then we will move rules folder & create & new rule/generate alert in rule by
creating myrules.rule
cd /etc/snort/rules
cat/vim myrules.rules (type the below code in it)
alert tcp ipadd any -> any any (msg:"Hello"; flags:S; sid:10000;)
alert tcp ipadd any -> ipadd any (msg:"You are captured"; nocase; sid:10002;)
#alert tcp/icmp any <> any any (msg:"you are gone"; sid:10003;)save and exit
After creating myrules.rules we will include in snort.conf file
cd ..
cd /etc/snort/snort.conf
vim snort.conf
Type -> include /etc/snort/rules/myrules.rules (save & exit)
Then type command
snort -d -l /var/log/snort/ -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i enp4s0
In another terminal
type command
tail -f /var/log/snort/alert
(Alert will be generated you can see it in)
cd /var/log/snort (ls -l /var/log/snort/ | grep alert)
ls -l
(you can see alert file)
